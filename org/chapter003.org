#+title: Chapter 3: Vector Fields and One-Form Fields

We want a way to think about how a function varies on a manifold. Suppose we
have some complex linkage, such as a multiple pendulum. The potential energy is
an important function on the multi-dimensional configuration manifold of the
linkage. To understand the dynamics of the linkage we need to know how the
potential energy changes as the configuration changes. The change in potential
energy for a step of a certain size in a particular di- rection in the
configuration space is a real physical quantity; it does not depend on how we
measure the direction or the step size. What exactly this means is to be
determined: What is a step size? What is a direction? We cannot subtract two
configurations to determine the distance between them. It is our job here to
make sense of this idea.

So we would like something like a derivative, but there are problems. Since we
cannot subtract two manifold points, we cannot take the derivative of a manifold
function in the way described in elementary calculus. But we can take the
derivative of a coordinate representation of a manifold function, because it
takes real-number coordinates as its arguments. This is a start, but it is not
independent of coordinate system. Let's see what we can build out of this.

** Vector Fields

In multiple dimensions the derivative of a function is the multiplier for the
best linear approximation of the function at each argument point:[fn:1]

\begin{equation}
f(x + \Delta x) \approx f(x) + (Df(x)) \Delta x
\end{equation}

The derivative $Df(x)$ is independent of $\Delta x$. Although the derivative
depends on the coordinates, the product $(Df(x)) \Delta x$ is invariant under
change of coordinates in the following sense. Let $\phi = \chi \circ
\chi^{\prime -1}$ be a coordinate transformation, and $x = \phi(y)$. Then
$\Delta x = D\phi(y)\Delta y$ is the linear approximation to the change in $x$
when $y$ changes by $\Delta y$. If $f$ and $g$ are the representations of a
manifold function in the two coordinate systems, $g(y) = f(\phi(y)) = f(x)$,
then the linear approximations to the increments in $f$ and $g$ are equal:

\begin{equation}
Dg(y)\Delta y = Df(\phi(y))(D\phi(y)\Delta y) = Df(x)\Delta x.
\end{equation}

The invariant product $(Df(x)) \Delta x$ is the /directional derivative/ of $f$
at $x$ with respect to the vector specified by the tuple of components $\Delta
x$ in the coordinate system. We can generalize this idea to allow the vector at
each point to depend on the point, making a /vector field/. Let b be a function
of coordinates. We then have a directional derivative of $f$ at each point $x$,
determined by $b$

\begin{equation}
D_b(f)(x) = (Df(x)) b(x).
\end{equation}

Now we bring this back to the manifold and develop a useful generalization of
the idea of directional derivative for functions on a manifold, rather than
functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. A /vector field/ on a manifold is an assignment of
a vector to each point on the manifold. In elementary geometry, a vector is an
arrow anchored at a point on the manifold with a magnitude and a direction. In
differential geometry, a vector is an operator that takes directional deriva-
tives of manifold functions at its anchor point. The direction and magnitude of
the vector are the direction and scale factor of the directional derivative.

Let $\mathsf{m}$ be a point on a manifold, $\mathsf{v}$ be a vector field on the
manifold, and $\mathsf{f}$ be a real-valued function on the manifold. Then
$\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})$ is the directional derivative of the function
$\mathsf{f}$ and $\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})$ is the directional
derivative of the function$\mathsf{f}$at the point $\mathsf{m}$. The vector
field is an operator that takes a real-valued manifold function and a manifold
point and produces a number. The order of arguments is chosen to make
$\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})$ be a new manifold function that can be manipulated
further. Directional derivative operators, unlike ordinary derivative operators,
produce a result of the same type as their argument. Note that there is no
mention here of any coordinate system. The vector field specifies a direction
and magnitude at each manifold point that is independent of how it is described
using any coordinate system.

A useful way to characterize a vector field in a particular coordinate system is
by applying it to the coordinate functions. The resulting functions
$b^i_{\chi,\mathsf{v}}$ are called the /coordinate component functions/ or
/coefficient functions/ of the vector field; they measure how quickly the
coordinate functions change in the direction of the vector field, scaled by the
magnitude of the vector field:

\begin{equation}
b^i_{\chi,\mathsf{v}} = \mathsf{v}(\chi^i) \circ \chi^{-1}.
\end{equation}

Note that we have chosen the coordinate components to be functions of the
coordinate tuple, not of a manifold point.

A vector with coordinate components $b_{\chi,\mathsf{v}}$ applies to a manifold
   function $\mathsf{f}$ via
   \begin{align}
   \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   &= ((D(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1}) b_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}) \circ \chi)(\mathsf{m}) \\
   &= D(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})) b_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \\
   &= \sum_i \partial_i (\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1}) (\chi(\mathsf{m})) b^i_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}(\chi (\mathsf{m})).
   \end{align}
   In equation (3.4), the quantity $\mathsf{f} \circ$ is the coordinate representation
   of the manifold function $\mathsf{f}$. We take its derivative, and weight
   the components of the derivative with the coordinate components
   $b_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}$ of the vector field that specify its direction and magnitude.
   Since this product is a function of coordinates we use $\chi$ to extract
   the coordinates from the manifold point m. In equation (3.5), the
   composition of the product with the coordinate chart $\chi$ is replaced
   by function evaluation. In equation (3.6) the tuple multiplication
   is expressed explicitly as a sum of products of corresponding com-
   ponents. So the application of the vector is a linear combination
   of the partial derivatives of $\mathsf{f}$ in the coordinate directions weighted
   by the vector components. This computes the rate of change of $\mathsf{f}$
   in the direction specified by the vector.

   Equations (3.3) and (3.5) are consistent:
   \begin{align}
   \mathsf{v}(x) (\chi^{-1}(x)) \nonumber
   &= D (\chi \circ \chi^{-1})(x) b_{\chi,\mathsf{v}}(x) \nonumber \\
   &= D(I)(x) b_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}(x) \nonumber \\
   &= b_{\chi,\mathsf{v}}(x).
   \end{align}

   The coefficient tuple $b_{\chi,\mathsf{v}}(x)$ is an up structure compatible for
   addition to the coordinates. Note that for any vector field v the coefficients
   $b_{\chi, \mathsf{v}}(x)$ are different for different coordinate functions $\chi$.
   In the text that follows we will usually drop the subscripts on $b$,
   understanding that it is dependent on the coordinate system and
   the vector field.

   We implement the definition of a vector field (3.4) as:
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define (components->vector-field components coordsys)
       (define (v f)
         (compose (* (D (compose f (point coordsys)))
                     components)
                  (chart coordsys)))
       (procedure->vector-field v))
   #+end_src

   The vector field is an operator, like derivative.[fn:2]

   Given a coordinate system and coefficient functions that map
   coordinates to real values, we can make a vector field. For example,
   a general vector field can be defined by giving components
   relative to the coordinate system ~R2-rect~ by
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define v
       (components->vector-field
        (up (literal-function ’b^0 R2->R)
            (literal-function ’b^1 R2->R))
        R2-rect))
   #+end_src
   To make it convenient to define literal vector fields we provide
   a shorthand: ~(define v (literal-vector-field ’b R2-rect))~
   This makes a vector field with component functions named ~b^0~
   and ~b^1~ and names the result ~v~. When this vector field is applied
   to an arbitrary manifold function it gives the directional derivative
   of that manifold function in the direction specified by the
   components ~b^0~ and ~b^1~:
   #+begin_src scheme
     ((v (literal-manifold-function ’f-rect R2-rect)) R2-rect-point)
     ;; (+ (* (((partial 0) f-rect) (up x0 y0)) (b?0 (up x0 y0)))
     ;;    (* (((partial 1) f-rect) (up x0 y0)) (b?1 (up x0 y0))))
   #+end_src
   This result is what we expect from equation (3.6).

   We can recover the coordinate components of the vector field
   by applying the vector field to the coordinate chart:
   #+begin_src scheme
     ((v (chart R2-rect)) R2-rect-point)
     ;; (up (b?0 (up x y)) (b?1 (up x y)))
   #+end_src

**** Coordinate Representation

     The vector field $\mathsf{v}$ has a coordinate representation $v$:
     \begin{align}
     \mathsf(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) \nonumber
     &= D(f \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})) b(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \nonumber \\
     &= Df(x) b(x) \\
     &= v(f)(x),
     \end{align}
     with the definitions $f = \mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1}$ and $x = \chi(\mathsf{m})$. The function $b$ is
     the coefficient function for the vector field $\mathsf{v}$. It provides a scale
     factor for the component in each coordinate direction. However, $v$
     is the coordinate representation of the vector field $\mathsf{v}$ in that it takes
     directional derivatives of coordinate representations of manifold
     functions.

     Given a vector field ~v~ and a coordinate system coordsys we can
     construct the coordinate representation of the vector field.[fn:3]
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define (coordinatize v coordsys)
         (define ((coordinatized-v f) x)
           (let ((b (compose (v (chart coordsys))
                             (point coordsys))))
             (* ((D f) x) (b x)))))
       (make-operator coordinatized-v))
     #+end_src
     We can apply a coordinatized vector field to a function of coordinates
     to get the same answer as before.
     #+begin_src scheme
       (((coordinatize v R2-rect) (literal-function ’f-rect R2->R))
        (up ’x0 ’y0))
       ;; (+ (* (((partial 0) f-rect) (up x0 y0)) (b?0 (up x0 y0)))
       ;;    (* (((partial 1) f-rect) (up x0 y0)) (b?1 (up x0 y0))))
     #+end_src

**** Vector Field Properties

     The vector fields on a manifold form a vector space over the field
     of real numbers and a module over the ring of real-valued manifold
     functions. A module is like a vector space except that there is no
     multiplicative inverse operation on the scalars of a module. Manifold
     functions that are not the zero function do not necessarily
     have multiplicative inverses, because they can have isolated zeros.
     So the manifold functions form a ring, not a field, and vector fields
     must be a module over the ring of manifold functions rather than
     a vector space.

     Vector fields have the following properties. Let $\mathsf{u}$ and $\mathsf{v}$ be
     vector fields and let $\alpha$ be a real-valued manifold function. Then
     \begin{align}
     &(\mathsf{u} + \mathsf{v})(f) = \mathsf{u}(\mathsf{f}) + \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}) \\
     &(\alpha \mathsf{f})(\mathsf{f}) = \alpha(\mathsf{u}(\mathsf{f})).
     \end{align}

     Vector fields are linear operators. Assume $\mathsf{f}$ and $\mathsf{g}$ are functions
     on the manifold, $a$ and $b$ are real constants.[fn:4] The constants $a$ and
     $b$ are not manifold functions, because vector fields take derivatives.
     See equation (3.13).
     \begin{align}
     &\mathsf{v}(a \mathsf{f} + b \mathsf{g}) (\mathsf{m})
     = a \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) + b \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{g})(\mathsf{m}) \\
     &\mathsf{v}(a \mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
     = a \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
     \end{align}
     Vector fields satisfy the product rule (Leibniz rule).
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf(\mathsf{fg})(\mathsf{m})
     = \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) \mathsf{g}(\mathsf{m})
     + \mathsf{f}(\mathsf{m}) \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{g})(\mathsf{m})
     \end{equation}
     Vector fields satisfy the chain rule. Let $F$ be a function on the
     range of $\mathsf{f}$.
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{v}(F \circ \mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
     = DF(\mathsf{f}(\mathsf{m})) \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
     \end{equation}

** Coordinate-Basis Vector Fields

   For an $n$-dimensional manifold any set of $n$ linearly independent
   vector fields[fn:5] form a /basis/ in that any vector field can be expressed
   as a linear combination of the basis fields with manifold-function
   coefficients. Given a coordinate system we can construct a basis
   as follows: we choose the component tuple $b_i(x)$ (see equation 3.5)
   to be the $i$th unit tuple $u_(x)$---an up tuple with one
   in the $i$th position and zeros in all other positions---selecting the
   partial derivative in that direction. Here $u_i$ is a constant function.
   Like $b$, it formally takes coordinates of a point as an argument,
   but it ignores them. We then define the basis vector field $\mathsf{X}_i$ by
   \begin{align}
   \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   &= D(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})) u_i(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \\
   &= \partial_i(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})).
   \end{align}

   In terms of $\mathsf{X}_i$ the vector field of equation (3.6) is
   \begin{equation}
   \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   = \sum_{i} \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{f}) (\mathsf{m}) b^i(\chi(\mathsf{m})).
   \end{equation}
   We can also write
   \begin{equation}
   \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   = \mathsf{X}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) b(\chi(\mathsf{m})),
   \end{equation}
   letting the tuple algebra do its job.

   The basis vector field is often written
   \begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} = \mathsf{X}_i,
   \end{equation}
   to call to mind that it is an operator that computes the directional
   derivative in the ith coordinate direction.

   In addition to making the coordinate functions, the procedure
   ~define-coordinates~ also makes the traditional named basis vectors.
   Using these we can examine the application of a rectangular
   basis vector to a polar coordinate function:
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define-coordinates (up x y) R2-rect)
     (define-coordinates (up r theta) R2-polar)
   #+end_src
   #+begin_src scheme
     ((d/dx (square r)) R2-rect-point)
     ;; (* 2 x0)
   #+end_src
   More general functions and vectors can be made as combinations
   of these simple pieces:
   #+begin_src scheme
     (((+ d/dx (* 2 d/dy)) (+ (square r) (* 3 x))) R2-rect-point)
     ;; (+ 3 (* 2 x0) (* 4 y0))
   #+end_src

**** Coordinate Transformations

     Consider a coordinate change from the chart $\chi$ to the chart $\chi'$.
     \begin{align}
     \mathsf{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{f})(m)
     &= D(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \nonumber \\
     &= D(\mathsf{f} \circ (\chi')^{-1} \circ \chi' \circ \chi^{-1})(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \nonumber \\
     &= D(\mathsf{f} ? (\chi')^{^1})(\chi'(\mathsf{m}))(D(\chi' \circ \chi^{-1}))(\chi(\mathsf{m})) \nonumber \\
     &= \mathsf{X}'(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})(D(\chi' \circ \chi^{-1}))(\chi(\mathsf{m})).
     \end{align}
     This is the rule for the transformation of basis vector fields. The
     second factor can be recognized as ``∂x'/∂x,'' the Jacobian.[fn:6]

     The vector field does not depend on coordinates. So, from
     equation (3.17), we have
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
     = \mathsf{X}(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) b(\chi(\mathsf{m}))
     = \mathsf{X}'(\mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m}) b'(\chi'(\mathsf{m})).
     \end{equation}
     Using equation (3.19) with $x = \chi(\mathsf{m})$ and $x' = \chi'(\mathsf{m})$, we deduce
     \begin{equation}
     D(\chi' \circ \chi^{-1})(x) b(x) = b'(x').
     \end{equation}
     Because $\chi' \circ \chi^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1}$, their derivatives
     are multiplicative inverses,
     \begin{equation}
     D(\chi' \circ \chi^{1})(x) = (D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{1})(x'))^{1},
     \end{equation}
     and so
     \begin{equation}
     b(x) = D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{1})(x') b'(x'),
     \end{equation}
     as expected.[fn:7]

     It is traditional to express this rule by saying that the basis
     elements transform /covariantly/ and the coefficients of a vector in
     terms of a basis transform contravariantly; their product is invariant
     under the transformation.

** Integral Curves

   A vector field gives a direction and rate for every point on a manifold.
   We can start at any point and go in the direction specified by
   the vector field, tracing out a parametric curve on the manifold.
   This curve is an /integral curve/ of the vector field.

   More formally, let $\mathsf{v}$ be a vector field on the manifold $\mathsf{M}$. An
   integral curve $\gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}} \colon \mathsf{R} \to \mathsf{M}$ of $\mathsf{v}$ is a parametric path on $\mathsf{M}$ satisfying
   \begin{align}
   D(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}}) (t)
   &= \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}) (\gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}}(t))
   = (\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}) \circ \gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}})(t) \\
   \gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}}(0)
   &= \mathsf{m},
   \end{align}
   for arbitrary functions $\mathsf{f}$ on the manifold, with real values or structured
   real values. The rate of change of a function along an integral
   curve is the vector field applied to the function evaluated at
   the appropriate place along the curve. Often we will simply write
   $\gamma$, rather than $\gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}}$. Another useful variation is $\phi^{\mathsf{v}}_t(\mathsf{m}) = \gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}}(t)$.

   We can recover the differential equations satisfied by a coordinate
   representation of the integral curve by letting $\mathsf{f} = \chi$, the
   coordinate function, and letting $\sigma = \chi \circ \gamma$ be the coordinate path
   corresponding to the curve $\gamma$. Then the derivative of the coordinate
   path $\sigma$ is
   \begin{align}
   D \sigma(t)
   &=  D(\chi \circ \gamma$)(t) \nonumber \\
   &= (\mathsf{v}(\chi) \circ \gamma)(t) \nonumber \\
   &= (\mathsf{v}(\chi) \circ \chi^{-1} \circ \chi \circ \gamma)(t) \\
   &= (b \circ \sigma)(t)
   \end{align}
   where $b = \mathsf{v}(\chi) \circ \chi^{-1}$ is the coefficient function for the vector field
   $\mathsf{v}$ for coordinates $\chi$ (see equation 3.7). So the coordinate path $\sigma$
   satisfies the differential equations
   \begin{equation}
   D \sigma = b \circ \sigma.
   \end{equation}

   Differential equations for the integral curve can be expressed
   only in a coordinate representation, because we cannot go from
   one point on the manifold to another by addition of an increment.
   However, we can do this by adding the coordinates to an increment
   of coordinates and then finding the corresponding point on the
   manifold.

   Iterating the process described by equation (3.24) we can compute
   higher-order derivatives of functions along the integral curve:
   \begin{align}
   D(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma)
   &= \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}) \circ \gamma \nonumber \\
   D^2(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma)
   &= D(\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}) \circ \gamma)
   = \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f})) \circ \gamma \nonumber \\
   &\cdots \nonumber \\
   D^n(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma)
   &= \mathsf{v}^n(\mathsf{f}) \circ \gamma
   \end{align}

   Thus, the evolution of $\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma$ can be written formally as a Taylor
   series in the parameter:
   \begin{align}
   &(f \circ \gamma)(t) \nonumber \\
   &= (f \circ \gamma)(0) + t D(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma)(0) + \frac{1}{2}t^2 D^2(\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma)(0) + \cdots \nonumber \\
   &= (e^{tD} (\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma))(0) \nonumber \\
   &= e^{t \mathsf{v} \mathsf{f}} (\gamma(0)).
   \end{align}
   Using $\phi$ rather than $\gamma$
   \begin{equation}
   (\mathsf{f} \circ \gamma^{\mathsf{v}}_{\mathsf{m}})(t)
   = (\mathsf{f} \circ \phi^{\mathsf{v}}_t)(\mathsf{m}),
   \end{equation}
   so, when the series converges,
   \begin{equation}
   (e^{t \mathsf{v}} \mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   = (\mathsf{f} \circ \phi^{\mathsf{v}}_t)(\mathsf{m}).
   \end{equation}

   In particular, let $\mathsf{f} = \chi$, then
   \begin{equation}
   \sigma(t)
   = (\chi \circ \gamma)(t)
   = (e^{tD} (\chi \circ \gamma))(0)
   = (e^{t \mathsf{v}} \chi) (\gamma(0)),
   \end{equation}
   a Taylor series representation of the solution to the differential
   equation (3.27).

   For example, a vector field \textsf{circular} that generates a rotation
   about the origin is:[fn:8]
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define circular (- (* x d/dy) (* y d/dx)))
   #+end_src
   We can exponentiate the circular vector field, to generate an
   evolution in a circle around the origin starting at ~(1, 0)~:
   #+begin_src scheme
     (series:for-each print-expression
                      (((exp (* ’t circular)) (chart R2-rect))
                       ((point R2-rect) (up 1 0)))
                      6)
     ;; (up 1 0)
     ;; (up 0 t)
     ;; (up (* -1/2 (expt t 2)) 0)
     ;; (up 0 (* -1/6 (expt t 3)))
     ;; (up (* 1/24 (expt t 4)) 0)
     ;; (up 0 (* 1/120 (expt t 5)))
   #+end_src
   These are the first six terms of the series expansion of the coordinates
   of the position for parameter ~t~.

   We can define an evolution operator $\mathsf{E}_{\Delta t, \mathsf{v}}$ using equation (3.31)
   \begin{equation}
   (E_{\Delta t, \mathsf{v}} \mathsf{f})(\mathsf{m})
   = (e^{\Delta t \mathsf{v}} \mathsf{f})(\mathsf`m`)
   = (\mathsf{f} \circ \phi^{\mathsf{v}}_{\Delta t}(\mathsf{m}).
   \end{equation}
   We can approximate the evolution operator by summing the
   series up to a given order:
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define ((((evolution order) delta-t v) f) m)
       (series:sum
        (((exp (* delta-t v)) f) m)
        order))
   #+end_src
   We can evolve circular from the initial point up to the parameter
   ~t~, and accumulate the first six terms as follows:
   #+begin_src scheme
     ((((evolution 6) ’delta-t circular) (chart R2-rect))
      ((point R2-rect) (up 1 0)))
     ;; (up (+ (* -1/720 (expt delta-t 6))
     ;;        (* 1/24 (expt delta-t 4))
     ;;        (* -1/2 (expt delta-t 2))
     ;;        1)
     ;;     (+ (* 1/120 (expt delta-t 5))
     ;;        (* -1/6 (expt delta-t 3))
     ;;        delta-t))
   #+end_src
   Note that these are just the series for $\cos \Delta t$ and $\sin \Delta t$, so the
   coordinate tuple of the evolved point is $(\cos \Delta t, \sin \Delta t)$.

   For functions whose series expansions have finite radius of convergence,
   evolution can progress beyond the point at which the
   Taylor series converges because evolution is well defined whenever
   the integral curve is defined.

   **Exercise 3.1: State Derivatives**

   Newton's equations for the motion of a particle in a plane, subject to
   a force that depends only on the position in the plane, are a system
   of second-order differential equations for the rectangular coordinates
   $(X, Y)$ of the particle:
   \begin{equation}
   D^2X(t)
   = A_x(X(t), Y(t)) \text{ and }
   D^2Y(t) = A_y (X(t), Y(t)),
   \end{equation}
   where $A$ is the acceleration of the particle.

   These are equivalent to a system of first-order equations for the coordinate
   path $\sigma = \chi \circ \gamma$, where $\chi = (\mathsf{t}, \mathsf{x}, \mathsf{y}, \mathsf{v}_x, \mathsf{v}_y)$ is a coordinate system
   on the manifold Rh $\mathbb{R}^5$. Then our equations are:
   \begin{align}
   D(\mathsf{t}   \circ \gamma) &= 1 \nonumber \\
   D(\mathsf{x}   \circ \gamma) &= \mathsf{v}_x \circ \gamma \nonumber \\
   D(\mathsf{y}   \circ \gamma) &= \mathsf{v}_y \circ \gamma \nonumber \\
   D(\mathsf{v}_x \circ \gamma) &= A_x(\mathsf{x} \circ \gamma, \mathsf{y} \circ \gamma) \nonumber \\
   D(\mathsf{v}_y \circ \gamma) &= A_y(\mathsf{x} \circ \gamma, \mathsf{y} \circ \gamma) \nonumber
   D(\mathsf{t} \circ \gamma) &= 1 \\
   \end{align}
   Construct a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^5$ corresponding to this system of differential
   equations. Derive the first few terms in the series solution of this
   problem by exponentiation.

** One-Form Fields

   A vector field that gives a velocity for each point on a topographic
   map of the surface of the Earth can be applied to a function, such
   as one that gives the height for each point on the topographic
   map, or a map that gives the temperature for each point. The
   vector field then provides the rate of change of the height or temperature
   as one moves in the way described by the vector field.
   Alternatively, we can think of a topographic map, which gives the
   height at each point, as measuring a velocity field at each point.
   For example, we may be interested in the velocity of the wind or
   the trajectories of migrating birds. The topographic map gives
   the rate of change of height at each point for each velocity vector
   field. The rate of change of height can be thought of as the
   number of equally-spaced (in height) contours that are pierced by
   each velocity vector in the vector field.

**** Differential of a Function

     For example, consider the /differential/[fn:9] df of a manifold function
     $\mathsf{f}$, defined as follows. If $\mathsf{df}$ is applied to a vector field $\mathsf{v}$ we obtain
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{df}(\mathsf{v}) = \mathsf{v}(\mathsf{f}),
     \end{equation}
     which is a function of a manifold point.

     The differential of the height function on the topographic map is
     a function that gives the rate of change of height at each point for
     a velocity vector field. This gives the same answer as the velocity
     vector field applied to the height function.

     The differential of a function is linear in the vector fields. The
     differential is also a linear operator on functions: if $\mathsf{f}_1$ and $\mathsf{f}_2$ are
     manifold functions, and if $c$ is a real constant, then
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{d}(\mathsf{f}_1 + \mathsf{f}_2) = \mathsf{df}_1 + \mathsf{df}_2
     \end{equation}
     and
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{d}(c \mathsf{f}) = c \mathsf{df}.
     \end{equation}
     Note that $c$ is not a manifold function.

**** One-Form Fields

     A one-form field is a generalization of this idea; it is something
     that measures a vector field at each point.

     /One-form fields/ are linear functions of vector fields that produce
     real-valued functions on the manifold. A one-form field is linear
     in vector fields: if $\omega$ is a one-form field, $\mathsf{v}$ and $\mathsf{w}$ are vector fields,
     and $c$ is a manifold function, then
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(\mathsf{v} + \mathsf{w}) = \omega(\mathsf{v}) + \omega(\mathsf{w})
     \end{equation}
     and
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(\mathsf{cv}) = \mathsf{c} \omega(\mathsf{v}).
     \end{equation}

     Sums and scalar products of one-form fields on a manifold have
     the following properties. If $\omega$ and $\theta$ are one-form fields, and if $\mathsf{f}$
     is a real-valued manifold function, then:
     \begin{equation}
     (\omega + \theta)(\mathsf{v}) &= \omega(\mathsf{v}) + \theta(\mathsf{v}), \\
     (\mathsf{f} \omega) (\mathsf{v}) &= \mathsf{f} \omega(\mathsf{v}).
     \end{equation}

**** Coordinate-Basis One-Form Fields

     Given a coordinate function $\chi$, we define the coordinate-basis one-form
     fields $\tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i$ by
     \begin{equation}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i (\mathsf{v}) (\mathsf{m}) = \mathsf{v}(\chi^i)(\mathsf{m})
     \end{equation}
     or collectively
     \begin{align}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{v})(\mathsf{m}) = \mathsf{v}(\chi) (\mathsf{m}).
     \end{align}
     With this definition the coordinate-basis one-form fields are dual
     to the coordinate-basis vector fields in the following sense (see
     equation 3.15):[fn:10]
     \begin{equation}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i (\mathsf{X}_j)(\mathsf{m})
     = \mathsf{X}_j (\chi^i)(\mathsf{m})
     = \partial_j (\chi^i \circ \chi^{-1}) (\chi(\mathsf{m}))
     &= \delta^i_j.
     \end{equation}
     The tuple of basis one-form fields $\tilde{X}(\mathsf{v})(\mathsf{m})$ is an up structure like
     that of $\chi$.

     The general one-form field $\omega$ is a linear combination of coordinate-basis
     one-form fields:
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(\mathsf{v}) = (a \circ \chi) \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{v})
     \end{equation}
     with coefficient-function tuple $a(x)$, for $x = \chi(\mathsf{m})$. We can write
     this more simply as
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(\mathsf{v}) = (a \circ \chi) \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{v}),
     \end{equation}
     because everything is evaluated at $\mathsf{m}$.

     The coefficient tuple can be recovered from the one-form field:[fn:11]
     \begin{equation}
     a_i(x) = \omega(\tilde{X}_i)(\chi^{-1}(x)).
     \end{equation}
     This follows from the dual relationship (3.41). We can see this as
     a program:[fn:12]
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define omega
         (components->1form-field
          (down (literal-function ’a
                                    0 R2->R)
                (literal-function ’a
                                    1 R2->R))
          R2-rect))
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((omega (down d/dx d/dy)) R2-rect-point)
;;       (down (a_0 (up x0 y0)) (a_1 (up x0 y0)))
     #+end_src
     We provide a shortcut for this construction:
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define omega (literal-1form-field 'a R2-rect))
     #+end_src

     A differential can be expanded in a coordinate basis:
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{df}(\mathsf{v}) = \sum_i \mathsf{c}_i \tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i (\mathsf{v}).
     \end{equation}
     The coefficients $\mathsf{c}_i = \mathsf{df}(\mathsf{X}_i) = \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{f}) = \partial_i(\mathsf{f} \circ \chi^{-1}) \circ \chi$ are the partial
     derivatives of the coordinate representation of $\mathsf{f}$ in the coordinate
     system of the basis:
     #+begin_src scheme
       (((d (literal-manifold-function 'f-rect R2-rect))
         (coordinate-system->vector-basis R2-rect))
        R2-rect-point)
       ;;(down (((partial 0) f-rect) (up x0 y0))
       ;;      (((partial 1) f-rect) (up x0 y0)))
     #+end_src
     However, if the coordinate system of the basis differs from the
     coordinates of the representation of the function, the result is
     complicated by the chain rule:

     #+begin_src scheme
       (((d (literal-manifold-function 'f-polar R2-polar))
         (coordinate-system->vector-basis R2-rect))
        ((point R2-polar) (up 'r 'theta)))
       ;;(down (- (* (((partial 0) f-polar) (up r theta)) (cos theta))
       ;;         (/ (* (((partial 1) f-polar) (up r theta))
       ;;               (sin theta))
       ;;            r))
       ;;      (+ (* (((partial 0) f-polar) (up r theta)) (sin theta))
       ;;         (/ (* (((partial 1) f-polar) (up r theta))
       ;;               (cos theta))
       ;;            r))
     #+end_src)
     The coordinate-basis one-form fields can be used to find the
     coefficients of vector fields in the corresponding coordinate vector-field
     basis:
     \begin{equation}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i(\mathsf{v}) = \mathsf{v}(\chi^i) = b^i \circ χ
     \end{equation}
     or collectively,
     \begin{equation}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{v}) = \mathsf{v}(\chi) = b \circ χ.
     \end{equation}

     A coordinate-basis one-form field is often written $\mathsf{dx}^i$. This
     traditional notation for the coordinate-basis one-form fields is justified
     by the relation:
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{dx}^i = \tilde{\mathsf{X}}^i = \mathsf{d} (\chi^i).
     \end{equation}
     The ~define-coordinates~ procedure also makes the basis one-form
     fields with these traditional names inherited from the coordinates.

     We can illlustrate the duality of the coordinate-basis vector
     fields and the coordinate-basis one-form fields:
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define-coordinates (up x y) R2-rect)
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dx d/dy) R2-rect-point)
       ;; 0
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dx d/dx) R2-rect-point)
       ;; 0
     #+end_src

     We can use the coordinate-basis one-form fields to extract the
     coefficients of ~circular~ on the rectangular vector basis:

     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dx circular) R2-rect-point)
       ;; (* -1 y0)
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dy circular) R2-rect-point)
       ;; x0
     #+end_src
     But we can also find the coefficients on the polar vector basis:
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dr circular) R2-rect-point)
       ;; 0
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((dtheta circular) R2-rect-point)
       ;; 1
     #+end_src
     So ~circular~ is the same as ~d/dtheta~, as we can see by applying
     them both to the general function ~f~:
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define f (literal-manifold-function ’f-rect R2-rect))
       (((- circular d/dtheta) f) R2-rect-point)
       0
     #+end_src
**** Not All One-Form Fields Are Differentials

     Although all one-form fields can be constructed as linear combinations
     of basis one-form fields, not all one-form fields are differentials
     of functions.

     The coefficients of a differential are (see equation 3.45):
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{c}_i = \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{f}) = \mathsf{df} (\mathsf{X}_i)
     \end{equation}
     and partial derivatives of functions commute
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{X}_j(\mathsf{f})) = \mathsf{X}_j(\mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{f})).
     \end{equation}
     As a consequence, the coefficients of a differential are constrained
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{X}_i(\mathsf{c}_j) = \mathsf{X}_j(\mathsf{c}_i),
     \end{equation}
     but a one-form field can be constructed with arbitrary coefficient
     functions. For example:
     \begin{equation}
     \mathsf{xdx} + \mathsf{xdy}
     \end{equation}
     is not a differential of any function. This is why we started with
     the basis one-form fields and built the general one-form fields in
     terms of them.

**** Coordinate Transformations

     Consider a coordinate change from the chart $\chi$ to the chart $\chi'$.
     \begin{align}
     \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(\mathsf{v})
     &= \mathsf{v}(\chi) \nonumber \\
     &= \mathsf{v}(\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1} \circ \chi') \nonumber \\
     &= (D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1}) \circ \chi') \mathsf{v}(\chi') \\
     &= (D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1}) \circ \chi') \circ \tilde{\mathsf{X}}'(v),
     \end{align}
     where the third line follows from the chain rule for vector fields.

     One-form fields are independent of coordinates. So,
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(v) = (a \circ \chi) \tilde{\mathsf{X}}(v) = (a' \circ \chi') \tilde{\mathsf{X}}'(v).
     \end{equation}
     Eqs. (3.54) and (3.53) require that the coefficients transform under
     coordinate transformations as follows:
     \begin{equation}
     a(\chi(\mathsf{m})) D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1})(\chi'(\mathsf{m})) = a'(\chi'(\mathsf{m})),
     \end{equation}
     or
     \begin{equation}
     a(\chi(\mathsf{m})) = a'(\chi'(\mathsf{m})) (D(\chi \circ (\chi')^{-1})(\chi'(\mathsf{m}gt)))^{-1}.
     \end{equation}

     The coefficient tuple $a(x)$ is a down structure compatible for
     contraction with $b(x)$. Let $\mathsf{v}$ be the vector with coefficient tuple
     $b(x)$, and $\omega$ be the one-form with coefficient tuple $a(x)$. Then, by
     equation (3.43),
     \begin{equation}
     \omega(\mathsf{v}) = (a \circ \chi) (b \circ \chi).
     \end{equation}
     As a program:
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define omega (literal-1form-field 'a R2-rect))
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       (define v (literal-vector-field 'b R2-rect))
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src scheme
       ((omega v) R2-rect-point)
       ;; (+ (* (b^0 (up x y)) (a_0 (up x0 y0)))
       ;;    (* (b^1 (up x y)) (a_1 (up x0 y0))))
     #+end_src

     Comparing equation (3.56) with equation (3.23) we see that
     one-form components and vector components transform oppositely,
     so that
     \begin{equation}
     a(x) b(x) = a'(x') b'(x'),
     \end{equation}
     as expected because $\omega(\mathsf{v})(\mathsf{m})$ is independent of coordinates.

     **Exercise 3.2: Verification**

     Verify that the coefficients of a one-form field transform as described in
     equation (3.56). You should use equation (3.44) in your derivation.

     **Exercise 3.3: Hill Climbing**

* Footnotes

[fn:1] In multiple dimensions the derivative $Df(x)$ is a down tuple structure
of the partial derivatives and the increment $\Delta x$ is an up tuple
structure, so the indicated product is to be interpreted as a contraction. (See
equation B.8.)
