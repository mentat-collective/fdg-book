#+title: Chapter 11: Special Relativity
#+STARTUP: noindent

Although the usual treatments of special relativity begin with the
Michelson-Morley experiment, this is not how Einstein began. In fact, Einstein
was impressed with Maxwell's work and he was emulating Maxwell's breakthrough.

Maxwell was preceded by Faraday, Ampere, Oersted, Coulomb, Gauss, and Franklin.
These giants discovered electromagnetism and worked out empirical equations that
described the phenomena. They understood the existence of conserved charges and
fields. Faraday invented the idea of lines of force by which fields can be
visualized.

Maxwell's great insight was noticing and resolving the contradiction between the
empirically-derived laws of electromagnetism and conservation of charge. He did
this by introducing the then experimentally undetectable displacement-current
term into one of the empirical equations. The modified equations implied a wave
equation and the propagation speed of the wave predicted by the new equation
turned out to be the speed of light, as measured by the eclipses of the Galilean
satellites of Jupiter. The experimental confirmation by Hertz of the existence
of electromagnetic radiation that obeyed Maxwell's equations capped the
discovery.

By analogy, Einsten noticed that Maxwell's equations were inconsistent with
Galilean relativity. In free space, where electromagnetic waves propagate,
Maxwell's equations say that the vector source of electric fields is the time
rate of change of the magnetic field and the vector source of magnetic field is
the time rate of change of the electric field. The combination of these ideas
yields the wave equation. The wave equation itself is not invariant under the
Galilean transformation: As Einstein noted, if you run with the propagation
speed of the wave there is no time variation in the field you observe, so there
is no space variation either, contradicting the wave equation. But the Maxwell
theory is beautiful, and it can be verified to a high degree of accuracy, so
there must be something wrong with Galilean relativity. Einstein resolved the
contradiction by generalizing the meaning of the Lorentz transformation, which
was invented to explain the failure of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Lorentz
and his colleagues decided that the problem with the Michelson-Morley experiment
was that matter interacting with the luminiferous ether contracts in the
direction of motion. To make this consistent he had to invent a "local time"
which had no clear interpretation. Einstein took the Lorentz transformation to
be a fundamental replacement for the Galilean transformation in all of
mechanics.

Now to the details. Before Maxwell the empirical laws of electromagnetism were
as follows. Electric fields arise from charges, with the inverse square law of
Coulomb. This is Carl Friedrich Gauss's law for electrostatics:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Magnetic fields do not have a scalar source. This is Gauss's law for
magnetostatics:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents, as discovered by Hans
Christian Oersted and quantified by André-Marie Ampère:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Michael Faraday (and Joseph Henry) discovered that electric fields are produced
by moving magnetic fields:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Benjamin Franklin was the first to understand that electrical charges are
conserved:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Although these equations are written in terms of the speed of light $c$, these
laws were originally written in terms of electrical permittivity and magnetic
permeability of free space, which could be determined by measurement of the
forces for given currents and charges.

It is easy to see that these equations are mutually contradictory. Indeed, if we
take the divergence of equation (11.3) we get

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

which directly contradicts conservation of charge (11.5).

Maxwell patched this bug by adding in the displacement current, changing
equation (11.3) to read

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Maxwell proceeded by taking the curl of equation (11.4) to get

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

Expanding the left-hand side

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

substituting from equations (11.7) and (11.1), and rearranging the terms we get
the inhomogeneous wave equation:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

We see that in free space (in the absence of any charges or currents) we have
the familiar homogeneous linear wave equation. A similar equation can be derived
for the magnetic field.

Lorentz, whom Einstein also greatly respected, developed a general formula to
describe the force on a particle with charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$
in an electromagnetic field:

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

A crucial point in Einstein's inspiration for relativity is, quoting Einstein
(in English translation), "During that year [1895--1896] in Aarau the question
came to me: If one runs after a light wave with light velocity, then one would
encounter a time-independent wavefield. However, something like that does not
seem to exist!"[fn:1] This was the observation of the inconsistency.

Let's be more precise about this. Consider a plane sinusoidal wave moving in the
$\hat{x}$ direction with velocity $c$ in free space ($\rho = 0$ and $\vec{I} =
0$). This is a perfectly good solution of the wave equation. Now suppose that an
observer is moving with the wave in the $\hat{x}$ direction with velocity $c$.
Such an observer will see no time variation of the field. So the wave equation
reduces to Laplace's equation. But a sinusoidal variation in space is not a
solution of Laplace's equation.

Einstein believed that the Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetic theory was
fundamentally correct, though he was unhappy with an apparent asymmetry in the
formulation. Consider a system consisting of a conductor and a magnet. If the
conductor is moved and the magnet is held stationary (a stationary magnetic
field) then the charge carriers in the conductor are subject to the Lorentz
force (11.11), causing them to move. However, if the magnet is moved past a
stationary conductor then the changing magnetic field induces an electric field
in the conductor by equation (11.4), which causes the charge carriers in the
conductor to move. The actual current which results is identical for both
explanations if the relative velocity of the magnet and the conductor are the
same. To Einstein, there should not have been two explanations for the same
phenomenon.

** Invariance of the Wave Equation

   Let $u = (t, x, y, z)$ be a tuple of time and space coordinates that specify
   a point in spacetime.[fn:2] If $\phi(t, x, y, z)$ is a scalar field over time
   and space, the homogeneous linear wave equation is

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

   The characteristics for this equation are the "light cones." If we define a
   function of spacetime points and increments, length, such that for an
   incremental tuple in position and time $\xi = (\Delta t, \Delta x, \Delta y,
   \Delta z)$ we have[fn:3]

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

   then the light cones are the hypersurfaces, for which

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

   This "length" is called the /interval/.

   What is the class of transformations of time and space coordinates that leave
   the Maxwell-Lorentz theory invariant? The transformations that preserve the
   wave equation are exactly those that leave its characteristics invariant. We
   consider a transformation $u = A(u^p\rime)$ of time and space coordinates:

\begin{equation}
t = A^0(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x = A^1(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
y = A^2(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
z = A^3(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime).
\end{equation}

   If we define a new field $\psi(t, x, y, z)$ such that $\psi = \phi \circ A$,
   or

\begin{equation}
\psi(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime) = \phi(A(t^\prime, x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime)),
\end{equation}

   Then $\psi$ will satisfy the wave equation

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

if and only if

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

   But this is just a statement that the velocity of light is invariant under
   change of the coordinate system. The class of transformations that satisfy
   equation (11.21) are the Poincaré transformations.

** Lorentz Transformations

   Special relativity is usually presented in terms of global Lorentz frames,
   with rectangular spatial coordinates. In this context the Lorentz
   transformations (and, more generally, the Poincaré transformations) can be
   characterized as the set of affine transformations (linear transformations
   plus shift) of the coordinate tuple (time and spatial rectangular
   coordinates) that preserve the length of incremental spacetime intervals as
   measured by

\begin{equation}
f(\xi) = -(\xi^0)^2 + (\xi^2)^2 + (\xi^2)^2 + (\xi^3)^2,
\end{equation}

   where $\xi$ is an incremental 4-tuple that could be added to the coordinate
   4-tuple $(ct, x, y, z)$.[fn:4] The Poincaré-Lorentz transformations are of
   the form

\begin{equation}
x = \Lambda x^\prime + a,
\end{equation}

   Where $\Lambda$ is the tuple representation of a linear transformation and
   $a$ is a 4-tuple shift. Because the 4-tuple includes the time, these
   transformations include transformations to a uniformly moving frame. A
   transformation that does not rotate or shift, but just introduces relative
   velocity, is sometimes called a /boost/.

   In general relativity, global Lorentz frames do not exist, and so global
   affine transformations are irrelevant. In general relativity Lorentz
   invariance is a local property of incremental 4-tuples at a point.

   Incremental 4-tuples transform as

\begin{equation}
\xi = \Lambda \xi^\prime.
\end{equation}

   This places a constraint on the allowed $\Lambda$

\begin{equation}
f(\xi^\prime) = f(\Lambda \xi^\prime),
\end{equation}

   for arbitrary $\xi^\prime$.

   The possible $\Lambda$ that are consistent with the preservation of the
   interval can be completely specified and conveniently parameterized.

** Simple Lorentz Transformations

   Consider the linear transformation, in the first two coordinates,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi^0 &= p(\xi^\prime)^0 + q(\xi^\prime)^1 \\
\xi^1 &= r(\xi^\prime)^0 + s(\xi^\prime)^1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   The requirement to preserve the interval gives the constraints

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
p^2 - r^2 &= 1, \\
pq - rs &= 0, \\
q^2 - s^2 &= -1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   There are four parameters to determine, and only three equations, so the
   solutions have a free parameter. It turns out that a good choice is $\beta =
   q/p$. Solve to find

\begin{equation}
p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \gamma(\beta),
\end{equation}

   and also $p = s$ and $q = r = \beta p$. This defines $\gamma$. Written out,
   the transformation is

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi^0 &= \gamma(\beta)\left((\xi^\prime)^0 + \beta(\xi^\prime)^1 \right) \\
\xi^1 &= \gamma(\beta)\left(\beta(\xi^\prime)^0 + (\xi^\prime)^1 \right).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   Simple physical arguments[fn:5] show that this mathematical result relates the
   time and space coordinates for two systems in uniform relative motion. The
   parameter $\beta$ is related to the relative velocity.

   Consider incremental vectors as spacetime vectors relative to an origin in a
   global inertial frame. So, for example, $\xi = (ct, x)$, ignoring $y$ and $z$
   for a moment. The unprimed coordinate origin $x = 0$ corresponds, in primed
   coordinates, to (using equations 11.29)

\begin{equation}
x = 0 = \gamma(\beta)(x^\prime + \beta c t'),
\end{equation}

   so

\begin{equation}
\beta = -\frac{x^\prime}{ct^\prime} = -\frac{v^\prime}{c},
\end{equation}

   with the definition $v^\prime = x^\prime / t^\prime$. We see that $\beta$ is
   minus $1/c$ times the velocity ($v^\prime$) of the unprimed system (which
   moves with its origin) as "seen" in the primed coordinates

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{x}{ct} = \frac{v}{c}.
\end{equation}

   So $v^\prime = -v$.

   A consistent interpretation is that the origin of the primed system moves
   with velocity v = βc along the ˆx-axis of the unprimed system. And the
   unprimed system moves with the same velocity in the other direction, when
   viewed in terms of the primed system. What happened to the other coordinates:
   y and z? We did not need them to find this one-parameter family of Lorentz
   transformations. They are left alone. This mathematical result has a physical
   interpretation: Lengths are not affected by perpendicular boosts. Think about
   two observers on a collision course, each carrying a meter stick
   perpendicular to their relative velocity. At the moment of impact, the meter
   sticks must coincide. The symmetry of the situation does not permit one
   observer to conclude that one meter stick is shorter than the other, because
   the other observer must come to the same conclusion. Both observers can put
   their conclusions to the test upon impact.

   We can fill in the components of this simple boost:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi^0 &= \gamma(\beta)\left((\xi^\prime)^0 + \beta(\xi^\prime)^1 \right) \\
\xi^1 &= \gamma(\beta)\left(\beta(\xi^\prime)^0 + (\xi^\prime)^1 \right) \\
\xi^2 &= (\xi^\prime)^2 \\
\xi^3 &= (\xi^\prime)^3.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

** More General Lorentz Transformations

   One direction was special in our consideration of simple boosts. We can make
   use of this fact to find boosts in any direction.

   Let $c \boldsymbol{\beta} = (v^0, v^1, v^2)$ be the tuple of components of
   the relative velocity of the origin of the primed system in the unprimed
   system. The components are with respect to the same rectangular basis used to
   define the spatial components of any incremental vector.

   An incremental vector can be decomposed into vectors parallel and
   perpendicular to the velocity. Let $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ be the tuple of spatial
   components of $\xi$, and $\xi^0$ be the time component. Then,

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi} = \boldsymbol{\xi}^\perp + \boldsymbol{\xi}^\parallel,
\end{equation}

   where $\boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{\xi} = 0$. (This is the ordinary
   dot product in three dimensions.) Explicitly,

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi}^\parallel \
= \frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{\xi} \right),
\end{equation}

   where $\beta = \left\Vert \boldsymbol{\beta} \right\Vert$, the magnitude of
   $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, and

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi}^\perp = \boldsymbol{\xi} - \boldsymbol{\xi}^\parallel.
\end{equation}

   In the simple boost of equation (11.33) we can identify $\xi^1$ with the
   magnitude $|\xi^{\Vert}|$ of the parallel component. The perpendicular
   component is unchanged:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi^0 &= \gamma(\beta)\left( (\xi^\prime)^0 + \beta |(\boldsymbol{\xi})^\parallel| \right), \\
|\boldsymbol{\xi}^\parallel| &= \gamma(\beta)\left( \beta(\xi^\prime)^0 + |(\boldsymbol{\xi})^\parallel| \right), \\
\boldsymbol{\xi}^\perp &= \left(\boldsymbol{\xi}^\prime\right)^\perp.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   Putting the components back together, this leads to

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\xi^0 &= \gamma(\beta)\left( (\xi^\prime)^0 + \boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{\xi} \right) \\
\boldsymbol{\xi} &= \gamma(\beta)\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}(\xi^\prime)^0 + \boldsymbol{\xi}^\prime \
+ \frac{\gamma(\beta) - 1}{\beta^2} \boldsymbol{\beta} \left( \boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \boldsymbol{\xi} \right) \right),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   which gives the components of the general boost $B$ along velocity $c
   \boldsymbol{\beta}$:

\begin{equation}
\xi = B(\boldsymbol{\beta})(\xi^\prime).
\end{equation}

** Implementation

   We represent a 4-tuple as a flat up-tuple of components.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (make-4tuple ct space)
  (up ct (ref space 0) (ref space 1) (ref space 2)))

(define (4tuple->ct v) (ref v 0))
(define (4tuple->space v)
  (up (ref v 1) (ref v 2) (ref v 3)))
   #+end_src

   The invariant interval is then

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (proper-space-interval 4tuple)
  (sqrt (- (square (4tuple->space 4tuple))
           (square (4tuple->ct 4tuple)))))
   #+end_src

   This is a real number for space-like intervals. A space-like interval is one
   where spatial distance is larger than can be traversed by light in the time
   interval.

   It is often convenient for the interval to be real for time-like intervals,
   where light can traverse the spatial distance in less than the time interval.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (proper-time-interval 4tuple)
  (sqrt (- (square (4tuple->ct 4tuple))
           (square (4tuple->space 4tuple)))))
   #+end_src

   The general boost $B$ is

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((general-boost beta) xi-p)
  (let ((gamma (expt (- 1 (square beta)) -1/2)))
    (let ((factor (/ (- gamma 1) (square beta))))
      (let ((xi-p-time (4tuple->ct xi-p))
            (xi-p-space (4tuple->space xi-p)))
        (let ((beta-dot-xi-p (dot-product beta xi-p-space)))
          (make-4-tuple
           (* gamma (+ xi-p-time beta-dot-xi-p))
           (+ (* gamma beta xi-p-time)
              xi-p-space
              (* factor beta beta-dot-xi-p))))))))
   #+end_src

   We can check that the interval is invariant:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(- (proper-space-interval
    ((general-boost (up 'vx 'vy 'vz))
     (make-4tuple 'ct (up 'x 'y 'z))))
   (proper-space-interval
    (make-4tuple 'ct (up 'x 'y 'z)))))
;; 0
   #+end_src

   It is inconvenient that the general boost as just defined does not work if
   $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is zero. An alternate way to specify a boost is through
   the magnitude of $v/c$ and a direction:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((general-boost2 direction v/c) 4tuple-prime)
  (let ((delta-ct-prime (4tuple->ct 4tuple-prime))
        (delta-x-prime (4tuple->space 4tuple-prime)))
    (let ((betasq (square v/c)))
      (let ((bx (dot-product direction delta-x-prime))
            (gamma (/ 1 (sqrt (- 1 betasq)))))
        (let ((alpha (- gamma 1)))
          (let ((delta-ct
                 (* gamma (+ delta-ct-prime (* bx v/c))))
                (delta-x
                 (+ (* gamma v/c direction delta-ct-prime)
                    delta-x-prime
                    (* alpha direction bx))))
            (make-4tuple delta-ct delta-x)))))))
   #+end_src

   This is well behaved as $v/c$ goes to zero.

** Rotations

   A linear transformation that does not change the magnitude of the spatial and
   time components, individually, leaves the interval invariant. So a
   transformation that rotates the spatial coordinates and leaves the time
   component unchanged is also a Lorentz transformation. Let $R$ be a
   3-dimensional rotation. Then the extension to a Lorentz transformation
   $\mathcal{R}$ is defined by

\begin{equation}
(\xi^0, \boldsymbol{\xi}) \
= \mathcal{R}(R)\left((\xi^\prime)^0, \boldsymbol{\xi}^\prime \right) \
= \left((\xi^\prime)^0, R(\boldsymbol{\xi}^\prime) \right).
\end{equation}

   Examining the expression for the general boost, equation (11.38), we see that
   the boost transforms simply as the arguments are rotated. Indeed,

\begin{equation}
B(\boldsymbol{\beta})=\left(\mathcal{R}(R) \right)^{-1} \circ B\left( R(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \right) \circ \mathcal{R}(R).
\end{equation}

   Note that $\left(\mathcal{R}(R) \right)^{-1} = \mathcal{R}(R^{=1})$. The
   functional inverse of the extended rotation is the extension of the inverse
   rotation. We could use this property of boosts to think of the general boost
   as a combination of a rotation and a simple boost along some special
   direction.

   The extended rotation can be implemented:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((extended-rotation R) xi)
  (make-4tuple
   (4tuple->ct xi)
   (R (4tuple->space xi))))
   #+end_src

   In terms of this we can check the relation between boosts and rotations:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((beta (up 'bx 'by 'bz))
      (xi (make-4tuple 'ct (up 'x 'y 'z)))
      (R (compose
          (rotate-x 'theta)
          (rotate-y 'phi)
          (rotate-z 'psi)))
      (R-inverse (compose
                  (rotate-z (- 'psi))
                  (rotate-y (- 'phi))
                  (rotate-x (- 'theta)))))
  (- ((general-boost beta) xi)
     ((compose (extended-rotation R-inverse)
               (general-boost (R beta))
               (extended-rotation R))
      xi)))
;; (up 0 0 0 0)
   #+end_src

** General Lorentz Transformations

   A Lorentz transformation carries an incremental 4-tuple to another 4-tuple. A
   general linear transformation on 4-tuples has sixteen free parameters. The
   interval is a symmetric quadratic form, so the requirement that the interval
   be preserved places only ten constraints on these parameters. Evidently there
   are six free parameters to the general Lorentz transformation. We already
   have three parameters that specify boosts (the three components of the boost
   velocity). And we have three more parameters in the extended rotations. The
   general Lorentz transformation can be constructed by combining generalized
   rotations and boosts.

   Any Lorentz transformation has a unique decomposition as a generalized
   rotation followed by a general boost. Any $\Lambda$ that preserves the
   interval can be written uniquely:

\begin{equation}
\Lambda = B(\boldsymbol{\beta})\mathcal{R}.
\end{equation}

   We can use property (11.41) to see this. Suppose we follow a general boost by
   a rotation. A new boost can be defined to absorb this rotation, but only if
   the boost is preceded by a suitable rotation:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}(R) \circ B(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = B\left(R(\boldsymbol{\beta})\right) \circ \mathcal{R}(R).
\end{equation}

*** Exercise 11.1: Lorentz Decomposition

    The counting of free parameters supports the conclusion that the general
    Lorentz transformation can be constructed by combining generalized rotations
    and boosts. Then the decomposition (11.42) follows from property (11.41).
    Find a more convincing proof.

** Special Relativity Frames

   A new frame is defined by a Poincaré transformation from a given frame (see
   equation 11.23). The transformation is specified by a boost magnitude and a
   unit-vector boost direction, relative to the given frame, and the position of
   the origin of the frame being defined in the given frame.

   Points in spacetime are called events. It must be possible to compare two
   events to determine if they are the same. This is accomplished in any
   particular experiment by building all frames involved in that experiment from
   a base frame, and representing the events as coordinates in that base frame.

   When one frame is built upon another, to determine the event from
   frame-specific coordinates or to determine the frame-specific coordinates for
   an event requires composition of the boosts that relate the frames to each
   other. The two procedures that are required to implement this strategy
   are[fn:6]

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((coordinates->event ancestor-frame this-frame
                             boost-direction v/c origin)
         coords)
  ((point ancestor-frame)
   (make-SR-coordinates ancestor-frame
                        (+ ((general-boost2 boost-direction v/c) coords)
                           origin))))

(define ((event->coordinates ancestor-frame this-frame
                             boost-direction v/c origin)
         event)
  (make-SR-coordinates this-frame
                       ((general-boost2 (- boost-direction) v/c)
                        (- ((chart ancestor-frame) event) origin))))
   #+end_src

   With these two procedures, the procedure =make-SR-frame= constructs a new
   relativistic frame by a Poincaré transformation from a given frame.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define make-SR-frame
  (frame-maker coordinates->event event->coordinates))
   #+end_src

*** Velocity Addition Formula


    For example, we can derive the traditional velocity addition formula. Assume
    that we have a base frame called =home=. We can make a frame =A= by a boost
    from home in the $\hat{x}$ direction, with components $(1, 0, 0)$, and with
    a dimensionless measure of the speed $v_a / c$. We also specify that the
    4-tuple origin of this new frame coincides with the origin of =home=.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define A
  (make-SR-frame 'A home
                 (up 1 0 0)
                 'va/c
                 (make-SR-coordinates home (up 0 0 0 0))))
    #+end_src

    Frame =B= is built on frame =A= similarly, boosted by $v_b/c$.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define B
  (make-SR-frame 'B A
                 (up 1 0 0)
                 'vb/c
                 (make-SR-coordinates A (up 0 0 0 0))))
    #+end_src

    So any point at rest in frame =B= will have a speed relative to home. For
    the spatial origin of frame =B=, with =B= coordinates =(up 'ct 0 0 0)=, we
    have

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((B-origin-home-coords
       ((chart home)
        ((point B)
         (make-SR-coordinates B (up 'ct 0 0 0))))))
  (/ (ref B-origin-home-coords 1)
     (ref B-origin-home-coords 0)))
;; (/ (+ va/c vb/c) (+ 1 (* va/c vb/c)))
    #+end_src

    obtaining the traditional velocity-addition formula. (Note that the
    resulting velocity is represented as a fraction of the speed of light.) This
    is a useful result, so:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (add-v/cs va/c vb/c)
  (/ (+ va/c vb/c)
     (+ 1 (* va/c vb/c))))
    #+end_src

** Twin Paradox

   Special relativity engenders a traditional conundrum: consider two twins, one
   of whom travels and the other stays at home. When the traveller returns it is
   discovered that the traveller has aged less than the twin who stayed at home.
   How is this possible?

   The experiment begins at the start event, which we arbitrarily place at the
   origin of the home frame.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define start-event
  ((point home)
   (make-SR-coordinates home (up 0 0 0 0))))
   #+end_src

   There is a homebody and a traveller. The traveller leaves home at the start
   event and proceeds at 24/25 of the speed of light in the $\hat{x}$ direction.
   We define a frame for the traveller, by boosting from the home frame.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define outgoing
  (make-SR-frame 'outgoing       ; for debugging
                 home            ; base frame
                 (up 1 0 0)      ; x direction
                 24/25           ; velocity as fraction of c
                 ((chart home)
                  start-event)))
   #+end_src

   After 25 years of home time the traveller is 24 light-years out. We define
   that event using the coordinates in the home frame. Here we scale the time
   coordinate by the speed of light so that the units of $ct$ slot in the
   4-vector are the same as the units in the spatial slots. Since $v/c$ = 24/25
   we must multiply that by the speed of light to get the velocity. This is
   multiplied by 25 years to get the $\hat{x}$ coordinate of the traveller in
   the home frame at the turning point.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define traveller-at-turning-point-event
  ((point home)
   (make-SR-coordinates home
                        (up (* :c 25) (* 25 24/25 :c) 0 0))))
   #+end_src

   Note that the first component of the coordinates of an event is the speed of
   light multiplied by time. The other components are distances. For example,
   the second component (the $\hat{x}$ component) is the distance travelled in
   25 years at 24/25 the speed of light. This is 24 light-years.

   If we examine the displacement of the traveller in his own frame we see that
   the traveller has aged 7 years and he has not moved from his spatial origin.

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(- ((chart outgoing) traveller-at-turning-point-event)
   ((chart outgoing) start-event))
;; (up (* 7 :c) 0 0 0)
   #+end_src

   But in the frame of the homebody we see that the time has advanced by 25
   years.

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(- ((chart home) traveller-at-turning-point-event)
   ((chart home) start-event))
;; (up (* 25 :c) (* 24 :c) 0 0)
   #+end_src

   The proper time interval is 7 years, as seen in any frame, because it
   measures the aging of the traveller:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart outgoing) traveller-at-turning-point-event)
    ((chart outgoing) start-event)))
;; (* 7 :c)
#+end_src

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart home) traveller-at-turning-point-event)
    ((chart home) start-event)))
;; (* 7 :c)
#+end_src

   When the traveller is at the turning point, the event of the homebody is:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(define halfway-at-home-event
  ((point home)
   (make-SR-coordinates home (up (* :c 25) 0 0 0))))
#+end_src

   and the homebody has aged

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart home) halfway-at-home-event)
    ((chart home) start-event)))
;; (* 25 :c)
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart outgoing) halfway-at-home-event)
    ((chart outgoing) start-event)))
;; (* 25 :c)
   #+end_src

   as seen from either frame.

   As seen by the traveller, home is moving in the $−\hat{x}$ direction at 24/25
   of the velocity of light. At the turning point (7 years by his time) home is
   at:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define home-at-outgoing-turning-point-event
  ((point outgoing)
   (make-SR-coordinates outgoing
                        (up (* 7 :c) (* 7 -24/25 :c) 0 0))))
   #+end_src

   Since home is speeding away from the traveller, the twin at home has aged
   less than the traveller. This may seem weird, but it is OK because this event
   is different from the halfway event in the home frame.

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart home) home-at-outgoing-turning-point-event)
    ((chart home) start-event)))
;; (* 49/25 :c)
   #+end_src

   The traveller turns around abruptly at this point (painful!) and begins the
   return trip. The incoming trip is the reverse of the outgoing trip, with
   origin at the turning-point event:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(define incoming
  (make-SR-frame 'incoming home
                 (up -1 0 0) 24/25
                 ((chart home)
                  traveller-at-turning-point-event)))
   #+end_src

   After 50 years of home time the traveller reunites with the homebody:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define end-event
  ((point home)
   (make-SR-coordinates home (up (* :c 50) 0 0 0))))
   #+end_src

   Indeed, the traveller comes home after 7 more years in the incoming frame:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(- ((chart incoming) end-event)
   (make-SR-coordinates incoming
                        (up (* :c 7) 0 0 0)))
;; (up 0 0 0 0)
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(- ((chart home) end-event)
   ((chart home)
    ((point incoming)
     (make-SR-coordinates incoming
                          (up (* :c 7) 0 0 0)))))
;; (up 0 0 0 0)
   #+end_src

   The traveller ages only 7 years on the return segment, so his total aging is
   14 years:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(+ (proper-time-interval
    (- ((chart outgoing) traveller-at-turning-point-event)
       ((chart outgoing) start-event)))
   (proper-time-interval
    (- ((chart incoming) end-event)
       ((chart incoming) traveller-at-turning-point-event))))
;; (* 14 :c)
   #+end_src

   But the homebody ages 50 years:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart home) end-event)
    ((chart home) start-event)))
;; (* 50 :c)
   #+end_src

   At the turning point of the traveller the homebody is at

   #+begin_src scheme
(define home-at-incoming-turning-point-event
  ((point incoming)
   (make-SR-coordinates incoming
                        (up 0 (* 7 -24/25 :c) 0 0))))
   #+end_src

   The time elapsed for the homebody between the reunion and the turning point
   of the homebody, as viewed by the incoming traveller, is about 2 years.

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(proper-time-interval
 (- ((chart home) end-event)
    ((chart home) home-at-incoming-turning-point-event)))
;; (* 49/25 :c)
   #+end_src

   Thus the aging of the homebody occurs at the turnaround, from the point of
   view of the traveller.

* Footnotes
[fn:6] The procedure =make-SR-coordinates= labels the given coordinates with the
given frame. The procedures that manipulate coordinates, such as =(point
ancestor-frame)=, check that the coordinates they are given are in the
appropriate frame. This error checking makes it easier to debug relativity
procedures.

[fn:5] See, for instance, Mermin, "Space and Time in Special Relativity."

[fn:4] Incrementally, $\xi = \xi^0 \partial / {\partial ct} + \xi^1 \partial /
{\partial x} + \xi^2 \partial / {\partial y} + \xi^3 \partial / {\partial z}$.
The length of this vector, using the Minkowski metric (see equation 10.11), is
the Lorentz interval, the right-hand side of equation (11.22).

[fn:3] Here the length is independent of the spacetime point specified by $u$.
In General Relativity we find that the metric, and thus the length function
needs to vary with the point in spacetime.

[fn:2] Points in spacetime are often called /events/.
