We often want to impose further structure on a manifold to allow us to define
lengths and angles. This is done by generalizing the idea of the Euclidean dot
product, which allows us to compute lengths of vectors and angles between
vectors in traditional vector algebra.

For vectors $\vec{u} = u^x\hat{x} + u^y\hat{y} + u^z\hat{z}$ and $\vec{v} =
v^x\hat{x} + v^y\hat{y} + v^z\hat{z}$ the dot product is $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}
= u^xv^x + u^yv^y + u^zv^z$. The generalization is to provide coefficients for
these terms and to include cross terms, consistent with the requirement that the
function of two vectors is symmetric. This symmetric, bilinear, real-valued
function of two vector fields is called a /metric field/.

For example, the natural metric on a sphere of radius $R$ is

\begin{equation}
\mathsf{g}(\mathsf{u}, \mathsf{v}) = \
R^2\left(\mathsf{d}\theta(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}\theta(\mathsf{v}) \
+ (\sin \theta)^2 \mathsf{d}\phi(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}\phi(\mathsf{v}) \right),
\end{equation}

and the Minkowski metric on the 4-dimensional space of special relativity is

\begin{equation}
\mathsf{g}(\mathsf{u}, \mathsf{v}) = \
\mathsf{d}x(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}x(\mathsf{v}) \
+ \mathsf{d}y(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}y(\mathsf{v}) \
+ \mathsf{d}z(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}z(\mathsf{v}) \
- c^2 \mathsf{d}t(\mathsf{u}) \mathsf{d}t(\mathsf{v}).
\end{equation}

Although these examples are expressed in terms of a coordinate basis, the value
of the metric on vector fields does not depend on the coordinate system that is
used to specify the metric.

Given a metric field $\mathsf{g}$ and a vector field $\mathsf{v}$ the scalar
field $\mathsf{g(v, v)}$ is the squared length of the vector at each point of
the manifold.

** Metric Music
   The metric can be used to construct a one-form field
   $\boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathsf{u}$ from a vector field $\mathsf{u}$, such that
   for any vector field $\mathsf{v}$ we have

\begin{equation}
\omega_\mathsf{u}(\mathsf{v}) = \mathsf{g(v, u)}.
\end{equation}

   The operation of constructing a one-form field from a vector field using a
   metric is called "lowering" the vector field. It is sometimes notated as

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathsf{u} = g^\flat(\mathsf{u}).
\end{equation}

   There is also an inverse metric that takes two one-form fields. It is defined
   by the relation

\begin{equation}
\delta_k^i = \sum_j {g^{-1} \left(\tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i, \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^j \right) \mathsf{g}(\mathsf{e}_j, \mathsf{e}_k)}.
\end{equation}

   where $\mathsf{e}$ and $\tilde{\mathsf{e}}$ are any basis and its dual basis.

   The inverse metric can be used to construct a vector field
   $\mathsf{v}_\omega$ from a one-form field $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, such that
   for any one-form field $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ we have

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathsf{v}_\omega) = \mathsf{g}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\omega}, \boldsymbol{\tau}).
\end{equation}

   This definition is implicit, but the vector field can be explicitly computed
   from the one-form field with respect to a basis as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathsf{v}_\omega = \sum_i {g^{-1} \left(\boldsymbol{\omega}, \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i \right) \mathsf{e}_i}.
\end{equation}

   The operation of constructing a vector field from a one-form field using a
   metric is called "raising" the one-form field. It is sometimes notated

\begin{equation}
\mathsf{v}_\omega = \mathsf{g}^\sharp(\boldsymbol{\omega}).
\end{equation}

   The raising and lowering operations allow one to interchange the vector
   fields and the one-form fields. However they should not be confused with the
   dual operation that allows one to construct a dual one-form basis from a
   vector basis or construct a vector basis from a one-form basis. The dual
   operation that interchanges bases is defined without assigning a metric
   structure on the space.

   Lowering a vector field with respect to a metric is a simple program:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((lower metric) u)
  (define (omega v) (metric v u))
  (procedure->1form-field omega))
   #+end_src

   But raising a one-form field to make a vector field is a bit more
   complicated:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (raise metric basis)
  (let ((gi (metric:invert metric basis)))
    (lambda (omega)
      (contract (lambda (e i w^i)
                  (* (gi omega w^i) e i))
                basis))))
   #+end_src

   where =contract= is the trace over a basis of a two-argument function that
   takes a vector field and a one-form field as its arguments.[fn:1]

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (contract proc basis)
  (let ((vector-basis (basis->vector-basis basis))
        (1form-basis (basis->1form-basis basis)))
    (s:sigma/r proc
               vector-basis
               1form-basis)))
   #+end_src

** Metric Compatibility

   A connection is said to be compatible with a metric $\mathsf{g}$ if the
   covariant derivative for that connection obeys the "product rule":

\begin{equation}
\Delta_\mathsf{X}\left(g(\mathsf{Y}, \mathsf{Z})\right) = g\left(\Delta_\mathsf{X}(\mathsf{Y}), \mathsf{Z}\right) \
+ g\left(\mathsf{Y}, \Delta_\mathsf{X}(\mathsf{Z})\right).
\end{equation}

   For a metric there is a unique torsion-free connection that is compatible
   with it. The Christoffel coefficients of the first kind are computed from the
   metric by the following:

\begin{equation}
\bar{\Gamma}_{i j k} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathsf{e}_{k}\left(\mathsf{g}\left(\mathsf{e}_{i}, \mathsf{e}_{j}\right)\right) \
+ \mathsf{e}_{j}\left(\mathsf{g}\left(\mathsf{e}_{i}, \mathsf{e}_{k}\right)\right) \
- \mathsf{e}_{i}\left(\mathsf{g}\left(\mathsf{e}_{j}, \mathsf{e}_{k}\right)\right)\right)
\end{equation}

   for the coordinate basis $\mathsf{e}$. We can then construct the Christoffel
   coefficients of the second kind (the ones used previously to define a
   connection) by "raising the first index." To do this we define a function of
   three vectors, with a weird currying:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{ijk} {\bar{\Gamma}_{ijk} \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i(\mathsf{u}) \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^j(\mathsf{v}) \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^k(\mathsf{w})}.
\end{equation}

   This function takes two vector fields and produces a one-form field. We can
   use it with equation (9.7) to construct a new function that takes two vector
   fields and produces a vector field:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\Gamma}(\mathsf{v}, \mathsf{w}) \
= \sum_i {\mathsf{g}^{-1} \left(\tilde{\Gamma}(\mathsf{v}, \mathsf{w}), \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i\right)\mathsf{e}_i}.
\end{equation}

   We can now construct the Christoffel coefficients of the second kind:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{jk}^i = \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i \left(\hat{\Gamma}\left(\mathsf{e}_j, \mathsf{e}_k \right)\right) \
= \sum_m \bar{\Gamma}_{mjk} \mathsf{g}^{-1} \left(\tilde{\mathsf{e}}^m, \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i \right)
\end{equation}

   The Cartan forms are then just

\begin{equation}
\varpi_j^i \
= \sum_k \Gamma_{jk}^i \tilde{\mathrm{e}}^k \
= \sum_k \tilde{\mathrm{e}}^i \left(\hat{\Gamma}\left(\mathrm{e}_j, \mathrm{e}_k \right)\right) \tilde{\mathrm{e}}^k.
\end{equation}

   So, for example, we can compute the Christoffel coefficients for the sphere
   from the metric for the sphere. First, we need the metric:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((g-sphere R) u v)
  (* (square R)
     (+ (* (dtheta u) (dtheta v))
        (* (compose (square sin) theta)
           (dphi u)
           (dphi v)))))
   #+end_src

   The Christoffel coefficients of the first kind are a complex structure with
   all three indices down:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
((Christoffel->symbols
  (metric->Christoffel-1 (g-sphere 'R) S2-basis))
 ((point S2-spherical) (up 'theta0 'phi0)))
;; (down
;;  (down (down 0 0)
;;        (down 0 (* (* (cos theta0) (sin theta0)) (expt R 2))))
;;  (down (down 0 (* (* (cos theta0) (sin theta0)) (expt R 2)))
;;        (down (* (* -1 (cos theta0) (sin theta0)) (expt R 2))
;;              0)))
   #+end_src

   And the Christoffel coefficients of the second kind have the innermost index
   up:

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
((Christoffel->symbols
  (metric->Christoffel-2 (g-sphere 'R) S2-basis))
 ((point S2-spherical) (up 'theta0 'phi0)))
;; (down (down (up 0 0)
;;             (up 0 (/ (cos theta0) (sin theta0))))
;;       (down (up 0 (/ (cos theta0) (sin theta0)))
;;             (up (* -1 (cos theta0) (sin theta0)) 0)))
   #+end_src

*** Exercise 9.1: Metric Compatibility

    The connections constructed from a metric by equation (9.13) are "metric
    compatible," as described in equation (9.9). Demonstrate that this is true
    for a literal metric, as described on page 6, in $\mathbf{R}^4$. Your
    program should produce a zero.

**  Metrics and Lagrange Equations

   In the Introduction (Chapter 1) we showed that the Lagrange equations for a
   free particle constrained to a 2-dimensional surface are equivalent to the
   geodesic equations for motion on that surface. We illustrated that in detail
   in Section 7.4 for motion on a sphere.

   Here we expand this understanding to show that the Christoffel symbols can be
   derived from the Lagrange equations. Specifically, if we solve the Lagrange
   equations for the acceleration (the highest-order derivatives) we find that
   the Christoffel symbols are the symmetrized coefficients of the quadratic
   velocity terms.

   Consider the Lagrange equations for a free particle, with Lagrangian

\begin{equation}
L_2(t, x, v) = \frac{1}{2}g(x)(v,v).
\end{equation}

   If we solve the Lagrange equations for the accelerations, the accelerations
   can be expressed with the geodesic equations (7.79):

\begin{equation}
D^2 q^i + \sum_{jk} \left(\Gamma_{jk}^i \circ \chi^{-1} \circ q \right) Dq^j Dq^{k} = 0.
\end{equation}

   We can verify this computationally. Given a metric, we can construct a
   Lagrangian where the kinetic energy is the metric applied to the velocity
   twice: The kinetic energy is proportional to the squared length of the
   velocity vector.

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (metric->Lagrangian metric coordsys)
  (define (L state)
    (let ((q (ref state 1)) (qd (ref state 2)))
      (define v
        (components->vector-field (lambda (m) qd) coordsys))
      ((* 1/2 (metric v v)) ((point coordsys) q))))
  L)
   #+end_src

   The following code compares the Christoffel symbols with the coefficients of
   the terms of second order in velocity appearing in the accelerations,
   determined by solving the Lagrange equations for the highest-order
   derivative.[fn:2] We extract these terms by taking two partials with respect to
   the structure of velocities. Because the elementary partials commute we get
   two copies of each coefficient, requiring a factor of 1/2.

   #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((metric (literal-metric 'g R3-rect))
       (q (typical-coords R3-rect))
       (L2 (metric->Lagrangian metric R3-rect)))
  (+ (* 1/2
        (((expt (partial 2) 2) (Lagrange-explicit L2))
         (up 't q (corresponding-velocities q))))
     ((Christoffel->symbols
       (metric->Christoffel-2 metric
                              (coordinate-system->basis R3-rect)))
      ((point R3-rect) q))))
;; (down (down (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0))
;;       (down (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0))
;;       (down (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0)))
   #+end_src

   We get a structure of zeros, demonstrating the correspondence between
   Christoffel symbols and coefficients of the Lagrange equations.

   Thus, if we have a metric specifying an inner product, the geodesic equations
   are equivalent to the Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian that is equal to
   the inner product of the generalized velocities with themselves

** Kinetic Energy or Arc Length

   A geodesic is a path of stationary length with respect to variations in the
   path that keep the endpoints fixed. On the other hand, the solutions of the
   Lagrange equations are paths of stationary action that keep the endpoints
   fixed. How are these solutions related?

   The integrand of the traditional action is the Lagrangian, which is in this
   case the Lagrangian $L_2$, the kinetic energy. The integrand of the arc
   length is

\begin{equation}
L_1(t, x, v) = \sqrt{g(x)(v, v)} = \sqrt{2L_2(t, x, v)}
\end{equation}

   and the path length is

\begin{equation}
\tau = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}{L_1\left(t, q(t), Dq(t)\right)dt}.
\end{equation}

   If we compute the Lagrange equations for $L_2$ we get the Lagrange equations
   for $L_1$ with a correction term. Since

\begin{equation}
L_2(t, x, v) = \frac{1}{2}(L_1(t, x, v))^2,
\end{equation}

   and the Lagrange operator for $L_2$ is[fn:3]

$$
\boldsymbol{E}[L_2] = D_t \partial_2 L_2 - \partial_1 L_2,
$$

   we find

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{E}[L_2] =L_1 \boldsymbol{E}[L_1] + \partial_2 L_1 D_t L_1.
\end{equation}

   $L_2$ is the kinetic energy. It is conserved along solution paths, since
   there is no explicit time dependence. Because of the relation between $L_1$
   and $L_2$, $L_1$ is also a conserved quantity. Let $L_1$ take the constant
   value $a$ on the geodesic coordinate path $q$ we are considering. Then $\tau
   = a(t_2 - t_1)$. Since $L_1$ is conserved, $(D_t L_1) \circ
   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}[q] = 0$ on the geodesic path $q$, and both
   $\boldsymbol{E}[L_1] \circ \boldsymbol{\Gamma}[q] = 0$ and
   $\boldsymbol{E}[L_2] \circ \boldsymbol{\Gamma}[q] = 0$, as required by
   equation (9.20).

   Since $L_2$ is homogeneous of degree 2 in the velocities, $L_1$ is
   homogeneous of degree 1. So we cannot solve for the highest-order derivative
   in the Lagrange-Euler equations derived from $L_1$: The Lagrange equations of
   the Lagrangian $L_1$ are dependent. But although they do not uniquely specify
   the evolution, they do specify the geodesic path.

   On the other hand, we can solve for the highest-order derivative in
   $\boldsymbol{E}[L_2]$. This is because $L_1 \boldsymbol{E}[L_1]$ is
   homogeneous of degree 2. So the equations derived from $L_2$ uniquely

*** For Two Dimensions

    We can show this is true for a 2-dimensional system with a general metric.
    We define the Lagrangians in terms of this metric:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define L2
  (metric->Lagrangian (literal-metric 'm R2-rect)
                      R2-rect))

(define (L1 state)
  (sqrt (* 2 (L2 state))))
    #+end_src

    Although the mass matrix of $L_2$ is nonsingular

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(determinant
 (((partial 2) ((partial 2) L2))
  (up 't (up 'x 'y) (up 'vx 'vy))))
;; (+ (* (m_00 (up x y)) (m_11 (up x y)))
;;    (* -1 (expt (m_01 (up x y)) 2)))
    #+end_src

    the mass matrix of $L_1$ has determinant zero

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(determinant
 (((partial 2) ((partial 2) L1))
  (up 't (up 'x 'y) (up 'vx 'vy))))
;; 0
    #+end_src

    showing that these Lagrange equations are dependent.

    We can show this dependence explicitly, for a simple system. Consider the
    simplest possible system, a geodesic (straight line) in a plane:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (L1 state)
  (sqrt (square (velocity state))))
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(((Lagrange-equations L1)
  (up (literal-function 'x) (literal-function 'y)))
 't)
;; (down
;;  (/ (+ (* (((expt D 2) x) t) (expt ((D y) t) 2))
;;        (* -1 ((D x) t) ((D y) t) (((expt D 2) y) t)))
;;     (expt (+ (expt ((D x) t) 2) (expt ((D y) t) 2)) 3/2))
;;  (/ (+ (* -1 (((expt D 2) x) t) ((D x) t) ((D y) t))
;;        (* (expt ((D x) t) 2) (((expt D 2) y) t)))
;;     (expt (+ (expt ((D x) t) 2) (expt ((D y) t) 2)) 3/2)))

    #+end_src

    These residuals must be zero; so the numerators must be zero.[fn:4] They
    are:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
D^2x\,(Dy)^2 &= Dx\,Dy\,D^2y \\
D^2x\,Dx\,Dy &= (Dx)^2\,D^2y
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

    Note that the only constraint is $D^2x\,Dy = Dx\,D^2y$, so the resulting
    Lagrange equations are dependent.

    This is enough to determine that the result is a straight line, without
    specifying the rate along the line. Suppose $y = f(x)$, for path $(x(t),
    y(t))$. Then

$$
Dy = Df(x)\,Dx\text{ and } D^2y = D^2f(x)\,Dx + Df(x)\,D^2(x).
$$

    Substituting, we get

$$
Df(x)\,Dx\,D^2x = Dx\left(D^2f(x)\,Dx + Df(x)\,D^2x\right)
$$

    or

$$
Df(x)\,D^2x = D^2f(x)\,Dx + Df(x)\,D^2x,
$$


    so $D^2f(x) = 0$. Thus $f$ is a straight line, as required.

*** Reparametrization

    More generally, a differential equation system $F[q](t) = 0$ is said to be
    /reparameterized/ if the coordinate path $q$ is replaced with a new
    coordinate path $q \circ f$. For example, we may change the scale of the
    independent variable. The system $F[q \circ f] = 0$ is said to be
    independent of the parameterization if and only if $F[q] \circ f = 0$. So
    the differential equation system is satisfied by $q \circ f$ if and only if
    it is satisfied by $q$.

    The Lagrangian $L_1$ is homogeneous of degree 1 in the velocities; so

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{E}[L_1] \circ \Gamma[q \circ f] \
- \left(\boldsymbol{E}[L_1] \circ \Gamma[q] \circ f\right) Df = 0.
\end{equation}

    We can check this in a simple case. For two dimensions $q = (x, y)$, the
    condition under which a reparameterization $f$ of the geodesic paths with
    coordinates $q$ satisfies the Lagrange equations for $L_1$ is:

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((x (literal-function 'x))
      (y (literal-function 'y))
      (f (literal-function 'f))
      (E1 (Euler-Lagrange-operator L1)))
  ((- (compose E1
               (Gamma (up (compose x f)
                          (compose y f))
                      4))
      (* (compose E1
                  (Gamma (up x y) 4)
                  f)
         (D f)))
   't))
;; (down 0 0)
    #+end_src

    This residual is identically satisfied, showing that the Lagrange equations
    for $L_1$ are independent of the parameterization of the independent
    variable.

    The Lagrangian $L_2$ is homogeneous of degree 2 in the velocities; so

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{E}[L_2][q \circ f] - (\boldsymbol{E}[L_2][q]  \circ f)(Df)^2 \
= \left(\partial_2 L_2 \circ \Gamma[q] \circ f\right)(D^2f).
\end{equation}

    Although the Euler-Lagrange equations for $L_1$ are invariant under an
    arbitrary reparameterization $(Df \ne 0)$, the Euler-Lagrange equations for
    $L_2$ are invariant only for a restricted set of $f$. The conditions under
    which a reparameterization $f$ of geodesic paths with coordinates $q$
    satisfies the Lagrange equations for $L_2$ are:

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((q (up (literal-function 'x) (literal-function 'y)))
      (f (literal-function 'f)))
  ((- (compose (Euler-Lagrange-operator L2)
               (Gamma (compose q f) 4))
      (* (compose (Euler-Lagrange-operator L2)
                  (Gamma q 4)
                  f)
         (expt (D f) 2)))
   't))
;; (down
;;  (* (+ (* ((D x) (f t)) (m 00 (up (x (f t)) (y (f t)))))
;;        (* ((D y) (f t)) (m 01 (up (x (f t)) (y (f t))))))
;;     (((expt D 2) f) t))
;;  (* (+ (* ((D x) (f t)) (m 01 (up (x (f t)) (y (f t)))))
;;        (* ((D y) (f t)) (m 11 (up (x (f t)) (y (f t))))))
;;     (((expt D 2) f) t)))
    #+end_src

    We see that if these expressions must be zero, then $D^2f = 0$. This tells
    us that $f$ is at most affine in $t: f(t) = at + b$.

*** Exercise 9.2: SO(3) Geodesics

    We have derived a basis for SO(3) in terms of incremental rotations around
    the rectangular axes. See equations (4.29, 4.30, 4.31). We can use the dual
    basis to define a metric on SO(3).

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (SO3-metric v1 v2)
  (+ (* (e^x v1) (e^x v2))
     (* (e^y v1) (e^y v2))
     (* (e^z v1) (e^z v2))))
    #+end_src

    This metric determines a connection. Show that uniform rotation about an
    arbitrary axis traces a geodesic on SO(3).

*** Exercise 9.3: Curvature of a Spherical Surface

    The 2-dimensional surface of a 3-dimensional sphere can be embedded in three
    dimensions with a metric that depends on the radius:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define M (make-manifold S^2-type 2 3))
(define spherical
  (coordinate-system-at 'spherical 'north-pole M))
(define-coordinates (up theta phi) spherical)
(define spherical-basis (coordinate-system->basis spherical))

(define ((spherical-metric r) v1 v2)
  (* (square r)
     (+ (* (dtheta v1) (dtheta v2))
        (* (square (sin theta))
           (dphi v1) (dphi v2)))))
    #+end_src

    If we raise one index of the Ricci tensor (see equation 8.20) by contracting
    it with the inverse of the metric tensor we can further contract it to
    obtain a scalar manifold function:

\begin{equation}
R = \sum_{ij} \mathsf{g}\left(\tilde{\mathsf{e}}^i, \tilde{\mathsf{e}}^j\right) \
 r\left(\mathsf{e}^i, \mathsf{e}^j\right).
\end{equation}

    The =trace2down= procedure converts a tensor that takes two vector fields
    into a tensor that takes a vector field and a one-form field, and then it
    contracts the result over a basis to make a trace. It is useful for getting
    the Ricci scalar from the Ricci tensor, given a metric and a basis.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((trace2down metric basis) tensor)
  (let ((inverse-metric-tensor
         (metric:invert metric-tensor basis)))
    (contract
     (lambda (v1 w1)
       (contract

     basis)))
    #+end_src

    Evaluate the Ricci scalar for a sphere of radius $r$ to obtain a measure of
    its intrinsic curvature. You should obtain the answer $2/r^2$.

*** Exercise 9.4: Curvature of a Pseudosphere

    Compute the scalar curvature of the pseudosphere (see exercise 8.2). You
    should obtain the value -2.

** General Relativity

   By analogy to Newtonian mechanics, relativistic mechanics has two parts.
   There are equations of motion that describe how particles move under the
   influence of "forces" and there are field equations that describe how the
   forces arise. In general relativity the only force considered is gravity.
   However, gravity is not treated as a force. Instead, gravity arises from
   curvature in the spacetime, and the equations of motion are motion along
   geodesics of that space.

   The geodesic equations for a spacetime with the metric

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

   are Newton's equations to lowest order in $V/c^2$:

\begin{equation}
D^2 \vec{x}(t) = - \mathrm{grad} \, V (\vec{x}(t)).
\end{equation}

*** Exercise 9.5: Newton's Equations

    Verify that Newton's equations (9.25) are indeed the lowest-order terms of
    the geodesic equations for the metric (9.24).

    Einstein's field equations tell how the local energy-momentum distribution
    determines the local shape of the spacetime, as described by the metric
    tensor $g$. The equations are traditionally written

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

    where $R_{\mu \nu}$ are the components of the Ricci tensor (equation 8.20),
    $R$ is the Ricci scalar (equation 9.23),[fn:5] and $\Lambda$ is the
    cosmological constant.

    $T_{\mu \nu}$ are the components of the stress-energy tensor describing the
    energy-momentum distribution. Equivalently, one can write

\begin{equation}
R_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} \left(T_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} T g_{\mu \nu} \right) - \Lambda g_{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}

    where $T =T_{\mu \nu} g^{\mu \nu}$.[fn:6]

    Einstein's field equations arise from a heuristic derivation by analogy to
    the Poisson equation for a Newtonian gravitational field:

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Lap}(V) = 4\pi G \rho
\end{equation}

    where $V$ is the gravitational potential field at a point, $\rho$ is the
    mass density at that point, and $\operatorname{Lap}$ is the Laplacian
    operator.

    The time-time component of the Ricci tensor derived from the metric (9.24)
    is the Laplacian of the potential, to lowest order.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (Newton-metric M G c V)
  (let ((a
         (+ 1 (* (/ 2 (square c))
                 (compose V (up x y z))))))
    (define (g v1 v2)
      (+ (* -1 (square c) a (dt v1) (dt v2))
         (* (dx v1) (dx v2))
         (* (dy v1) (dy v2))
         (* (dz v1) (dz v2))))
    g))

(define (Newton-connection M G c V)
  (Christoffel->Cartan
   (metric->Christoffel-2 (Newton-metric M G c V)
                          spacetime-rect-basis)))

(define nabla
  (covariant-derivative
   (Newton-connection 'M 'G ':c
                      (literal-function 'V (-> (UP Real Real Real) Real)))))

    #+end_src

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(((Ricci nabla (coordinate-system->basis spacetime-rect))
  d/dt d/dt)
 ((point spacetime-rect) (up 't 'x 'y 'z)))
;; mess
    #+end_src

    The leading terms of the mess are

    #+begin_src scheme :eval none
(+ (((partial 0) ((partial 0) V)) (up x y z))
   (((partial 1) ((partial 1) V)) (up x y z))
   (((partial 2) ((partial 2) V)) (up x y z)))
    #+end_src

    which is the Laplacian of V . The other terms are smaller by $V/c^2$.

    Now consider the right-hand side of equation (9.27). In the Poisson equation
    the source of the gravitational potential is the density of matter. Let the
    time-time component of the stress-energy tensor $T_{00}$ be the matter
    density $\rho$. Here is a program for the stress-energy tensor:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (Tdust rho)
  (define (T w1 w2)
    (* rho (w1 d/dt) (w2 d/dt)))
  T)
    #+end_src

    If we evaluate the right-hand side expression we obtain[fn:7]

    #+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((g (Newton-metric 'M 'G ':c V)))
  (let ((T ij ((drop2 g spacetime-rect-basis) (Tdust 'rho))))
    (let ((T ((trace2down g spacetime-rect-basis) T ij)))
      ((- (T ij d/dt d/dt) (* 1/2 T (g d/dt d/dt)))
       ((point spacetime-rect) (up 't 'x 'y 'z))))))
;; (* 1/2 (expt :c 4) rho)
    #+end_src

    So, to make the Poisson analogy we get

\begin{equation}
R_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} \left(T_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} T g_{\mu \nu} \right) - \Lambda g_{\mu \nu}
\end{equation}

    as required.

*** Exercise 9.6: Curvature of Schwarzschild Spacetime

    In spherical coordinates around a nonrotating gravitating body the metric of
    Schwarzschild spacetime is given as:[fn:8]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define-coordinates (up t r theta phi) spacetime-sphere)

(define (Schwarzschild-metric M G c)
  (let ((a (- 1 (/ (* 2 G M) (* (square c) r)))))
    (lambda (v1 v2)
      (+ (* -1 (square c) a (dt v1) (dt v2))
         (* (/ 1 a) (dr v1) (dr v2))
         (* (square r)
            (+ (* (dtheta v1) (dtheta v2))
               (* (square (sin theta))
                  (dphi v1) (dphi v2))))))))
    #+end_src

    Show that the Ricci curvature of the Schwarzschild spacetime is zero. Use
    the definition of the Ricci tensor in equation (8.20).

*** Exercise 9.7: Circular Orbits in Schwarzschild Spacetime

    Test particles move along geodesics in spacetime. Now that we have a metric
    for Schwarzschild spacetime (page 147) we can use it to construct the
    geodesic equations and determine how test particles move. Consider circular
    orbits. For example, the circular orbit along a line of constant longitude
    is a geodesic, so it should satisfy the geodesic equations. Here is the
    equation of a circular path along the zero longitude line.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (prime-meridian r omega)
  (compose (point spacetime-sphere)
           (lambda (t) (up t r (* omega t) 0))
           (chart R1-rect)))
    #+end_src

    This equation will satisfy the geodesic equations for compatible values of
    the radius =r= and the angular velocity =omega. If you substitute this into
    the geodesic equation and set the residual to zero you will obtain a
    constraint relating =r and =omega=. Do it.

    Surprise: You should find out that $\omega^2 r^3 = GM$ --- Kepler's law!

*** Exercise 9.8: Stability of Circular Orbits

    In Schwarzschild spacetime there are stable circular orbits if the
    coordinate $r$ is large enough, but below that value all orbits are
    unstable. The critical value of $r$ is larger than the Schwarzschild horizon
    radius. Let's find that value.

    For example, we can consider a perturbation of the orbit of constant
    longitude. Here is the result of adding an exponential variation of size
    =epsilon=:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (prime-meridian+X r epsilon X)
  (compose
   (point spacetime-sphere)
   (lambda (t)
     (up (+ t (* epsilon (* (ref X 0) (exp (* 'lambda t)))))
         (+ r (* epsilon (* (ref X 1) (exp (* 'lambda t)))))
         (+ (* (sqrt (/ (* 'G 'M) (expt r 3))) t)
            (* epsilon (* (ref X 2) (exp (* 'lambda t)))))
         0))
   (chart R1-rect)))
    #+end_src

    Plugging this into the geodesic equation yields a structure of residuals:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (geodesic-equation+X-residuals eps X)
  (let ((gamma (prime-meridian+X 'r eps X)))
    (((((covariant-derivative Cartan gamma) d/dtau)
       ((differential gamma) d/dtau))
      (chart spacetime-sphere))
     ((point R1-rect) 't))))
    #+end_src

    The characteristic equation in the eigenvalue =lambda= can be obtained as the
    numerator of the expression:

    #+begin_src scheme
(determinant
 (submatrix (((* (partial 1) (partial 0))
              geodesic-equation+X-residuals)
             0
             (up 0 0 0))
            0 3 0 3))
    #+end_src

    Show that the orbits are unstable if $r < 6GM / c^2$.

*** Exercise 9.9: Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker

    The Einstein tensor $G_{\mu \nu}$ (see footnote 5) can be expressed as a
    program:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (Einstein coordinate-system metric-tensor)
  (let* ((basis (coordinate-system->basis coordinate-system))
         (connection
          (Christoffel->Cartan
           (metric->Christoffel-2 metric-tensor basis)))
         (nabla (covariant-derivative connection))
         (Ricci-tensor (Ricci nabla basis))
         (Ricci-scalar
          ((trace2down metric-tensor basis) Ricci-tensor)))
    (define (Einstein-tensor v1 v2)
      (- (Ricci-tensor v1 v2)
         (* 1/2 Ricci-scalar (metric-tensor v1 v2))))
    Einstein-tensor))

(define (Einstein-field-equation
         coordinate-system metric-tensor Lambda stress-energy-tensor)
  (let ((Einstein-tensor
         (Einstein coordinate-system metric-tensor)))
    (define EFE-residuals
      (- (+ Einstein-tensor (* Lambda metric-tensor))
         (* (/ (* 8 :pi :G) (expt :c 4))
            stress-energy-tensor)))
    EFE-residuals))
    #+end_src

    One exact solution to the Einstein equations was found by Alexander
    Friedmann in 1922. He showed that a metric for an isotropic and homogeneous
    spacetime was consistent with a similarly isotropic and homogeneous
    stress-energy tensor in Einstein's equations. In this case the residuals of
    the Einstein equations gave ordinary differential equations for the
    time-dependent scale of the universe. These are called the Robertson-Walker
    equations. Friedmann's metric is:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (FLRW-metric c k R)
  (define-coordinates (up t r theta phi) spacetime-sphere)
  (let ((a (/ (square (compose R t)) (- 1 (* k (square r)))))
        (b (square (* (compose R t) r))))
    (define (g v1 v2)
      (+ (* -1 (square c) (dt v1) (dt v2))
         (* a (dr v1) (dr v2))
         (* b (+ (* (dtheta v1) (dtheta v2))
                 (* (square (sin theta))
                    (dphi v1) (dphi v2))))))
    g))
    #+end_src

    Here =c= is the speed of light, =k= is the intrinsic curvature, and =R= is a
    length scale that is a function of time.

    The associated stress-energy tensor is

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (Tperfect-fluid rho p c metric)
  (define-coordinates (up t r theta phi) spacetime-sphere)
  (let* ((basis (coordinate-system->basis spacetime-sphere))
         (inverse-metric (metric:invert metric basis)))
    (define (T w1 w2)
      (+ (* (+ (compose rho t)
               (/ (compose p t) (square c)))
            (w1 d/dt) (w2 d/dt))
         (* (compose p t) (inverse-metric w1 w2))))
    T))
    #+end_src

    where =rho is the energy density, and =p= is the pressure in an ideal fluid
    model.

    The Robertson-Walker equations are:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{DR(t)}{R(t)} \right)^2 + \frac{kc^2}{(R(t))^2} - \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3} = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho(t), \\
2 \frac{D^2 R(t)}{R(t)} - \frac{2}{3} \Lambda c^2 = -8 \pi G \left(\frac{\rho(t)}{3} + \frac{p(t)}{c^2} \right).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

    Use the programs supplied to derive the Robertson-Walker equations.

*** Exercise 9.10: Cosmology

    For energy to be conserved, the stress-energy tensor must be constrained so
    that its covariant divergence is zero

\begin{equation}
\sum_\mu \Delta_{e_\mu} T\left(\tilde{\mathsf{e}}^\mu, \omega \right) = 0
\end{equation}

    for every one-form $\omega$.

    a. Show that for the perfect fluid stress-energy tensor and the FLRW metric
       this constraint is equivalent to the differential equation

\begin{equation}
D\left(c^2 \rho R^3\right) + pD\left(R^3\right) = 0.
\end{equation}

    b. Assume that in a "matter-dominated universe" radiation pressure is
       negligible, so $p = 0$. Using the Robertson-Walker equations (9.30) and
       the energy conservation equation (9.32) show that the observation of an
       expanding universe is compatible with a negative curvature universe, a
       flat universe, or a positive curvature universe: $k \in \left\{-1, 0,
       +1\right\}$.

* Footnotes

[fn:8] The spacetime manifold is built from $\mathbf{R}^4$ with the addition of
appropriate coordinate systems:

#+begin_src scheme
(define spacetime (make-manifold R^n 4))
(define spacetime-rect
  (coordinate-system-at 'rectangular 'origin spacetime))
(define spacetime-sphere
  (coordinate-system-at 'spacetime-spherical 'origin spacetime))
#+end_src

[fn:7] The procedure =trace2down= is defined on page 144. This expression also
uses =drop2=, which converts a tensor field that takes two one-form fields into a
tensor field that takes two vector fields. Its definition is

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((drop2 metric-tensor basis) tensor)
  (lambda (v1 v2)
    (contract
     (lambda (e1 w1)
       (contract
        (lambda (e2 w2)
          (* (metric-tensor v1 e1) (tensor w1 w2) (metric-tensor e2 v2)))
        basis))
     basis)))
#+end_src

[fn:6] Start with equation (9.26). Raise one index of both sides, and then
contract. Notice that the trace $g_\mu^\mu = 4$, the dimension of spacetime.
This gets $R = -\left(\frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}\right) T$ , from which we can deduce
equation (9.27).

[fn:5] The tensor with components $G_{\mu \nu} = R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R
g_{\mu \nu}$ is called the Einstein tensor. In his search for an appropriate
field equation for gravity, Einstein demanded /general covariance/ (independence
of coordinate system) and local Lorentz invariance (at each point
transformations must preserve the line element). These considerations led
Einstein to look for a tensor equation (see Appendix C).

[fn:4] We cheated: We hand-simplified the denominator to make the result more
obvious.

[fn:3] $\mathbf{E}$ is the Euler-Lagrange operator, which gives the residuals of
the Lagrange equations for a Lagrangian. $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ extends a
configuration-space path $q$ to make a state-space path, with as many terms as
needed: $\mathbf{\Gamma}[q](t) = (t, q(t), Dq(t), \ldots)$. The total time
derivative $D_t$ is defined by $D_t F \circ \mathbf{\Gamma}[q] = D\left(F \circ
\mathbf{\Gamma}[q]\right)$ for any state function $F$ and path $q$. The Lagrange
equations are $\mathbf{E}[L] \circ \Gamma[q] = 0$. See [19] for more details.

[fn:2] The procedure =Lagrange-explicit= produces the accelerations of the
coordinates. In this code the division operator (=/=) multiplies its first
argument on the left by the inverse of its second argument.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (Lagrange-explicit L)
  (let ((P ((partial 2) L))
        (F ((partial 1) L)))
    (/ (- F (+ ((partial 0) P) (* ((partial 1) P) velocity)))
       ((partial 2) P))))
#+end_src

[fn:1] Notice that =raise= and =lower= are not symmetrical. This is because
vector fields and form fields are not symmetrical: a vector field takes a
manifold function as its argument, whereas a form field takes a vector field as
its argument. This asymmetry is not apparent in traditional treatments based on
index notation.
